#                     IMPORTANT INFORMATION                 #
#-----------------------------------------------------------#

# This is used to determine what version of the config you are using.
# Please do not change this as it may cause issues with your config.
version: 1

# This will automatically move your current config to "config-old.yml" and replace with a new, updated, "config.yml".
# If you ever get tired of your config being moved, just change this to "false".
auto-update-config: true

# This is used for the Guild's Announcement System, which allow me (The Author) to communicate to you guys without updating.
# The way this works is very simple. If you have "console" set to "true", you will see the announcement when the server starts.
# If you have "in-game" set to "true", your OPed players will see it the first time they login to the server.
# OPed players will only be notified on the first time they login after each server reboot.
announcements:
  console: true
  in-game: true

#-----------------------------------------------------------#
# This section of the config will allow you to handle guild land claiming.
# Remember that the enable / disable for this is the WorldGuard Hook at the TOP of the config.
# There are multiple options when it comes to guild claims. For the time being, all guilds will only get one claim.
# As a server owner, you will have a few options here.
# First off, you will have the ability to have a standard set claim size.
# There is an option you can modify if you want players to be able to set their own claim size.
# Don't worry, you will be able to modify the max claim size to prevent abuse.

# This is the number of blocks around the player it will try to create the region
# Keep in mind this is the RADIUS, it will go this many blocks in both directions
# For example, if you take the default 15, it'll do 30 total as it will go
# 15 blocks in both directions
# This is a CUBOID region, not SPHERE

# DO NOT set it to 0, that will either throw errors or cause mobs to not drop XP.

# You can make as many as you want. You MUST name each tier "tier1, tier2, tier3, etc." while following the format of the already made ones.
# For example: if I wanted to add a 4th tier, I would do this:

# tier4:
#   name: "Diamond"
#   cost: 400
#   max-members: 100
#   mob-xp-multiplier: 4
#   damage-multiplier: 4
#   max-bank-balance: 40000
#   permissions:
#    - "example.permission.one"
#    - "example.permission.two"

# Keep in mind for the damage-multiplier, it applies to players also, so by default it's set to normal for every tier to allow you
# to choose how it will work.
